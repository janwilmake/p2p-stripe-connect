This little app (https://p2p-stripe-connect.wilmake.com) allows for X Login and p2p payments between X users. It uses a global durable object with SQLite to facilitate transactions, and in essence is a ledger for Stripe Connect. It allows depositing money with stripe, sending to other users, even if they're not on the platform yet, and withdrawing money using Stripe Connect.

The demo version (https://p2p-stripe-connect.wilmake.com) uses test api keys (A sandbox) so you can deposit money for free.
